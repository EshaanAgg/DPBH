# Dark Buster

`Dark Buster` is a Chrome extension that detects and highlights dark patterns on shopping websites. It reads text on product pages of shopping websites, then identifies and classifies dark pattern text. These potential dark patterns are then highlighted, with a popup that identifies and explains the category to which a given dark pattern belongs.

This project was the first runner-up in the Dark Pattern Buster Hackathon 2023, organized by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and IIT (BHU) Varanasi.
